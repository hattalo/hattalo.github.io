FEATURES OF PROTO-URALIC</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><b>General</b></p>

<p>Every scientific society loves its old traditional theories.
Scientific paradigm changes itself from time to time. The change
of scientific paradigm turns old traditional scientific theories
to myths. The majority of scientists cannot believe that old
scientific paradigms turn to myths. There are always some rebels
in science. The paradigm of Uralistics is changing just now under
the leadership of some Uralistic rebels. Their war against
tradition is not Uralic-nationalistic: the paradigm of humanities
is being changed by the Indo-European scientists, not by the
Uralic ones. The Indo-Europists started it in the first place.
The very first ideas concerning the Uralians as the first wave of
migration that reached Northern Europe are proposed by the
Indo-European archaeologists (Russian Pavel Dolukhanov in
England, Czeck Miloslav Zvelebil in Czeckia and Cubinian Milton
Nuñez in Finland). Quite a different thing is that this paradigm
changes and the changes in scientific views of the rebels
concerning the Uralistics are suitable for the new scientific
identity of Hungarians, Estonians and Finns. It just so happened,
it was not for nationalistic purposes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><b>Uralistics</b></p>

<p>Indo-European scientists are interested in the Uralistics,
too. Uralists must help them in their work as they know more
about Uralic languages, archaeology, history, physical
anthropology, genetics etc.</p>

<p>Geneticists look at Finno-Ugrians as pure Europoids
(Caucasoids) and Samoyeds as pure Mongoloids. Geneticists are
strictly asking for our help. They say: we have a lot of genetic
data but no idea how to work with these data. Give us such ideas,
theories, hypotheses and we will check them. Geneticists cannot
work with their databanks without concrete aims – databanks are
so large that they overload the computers: the capacity of
computers ends. Uralists must help them. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><b>My main considerations</b></p>

<p>There was no narrow Uralic proto-home with a unitary Uralic
proto-language, proto-race, proto-culture, proto-religion etc. in
the east in the Volga or southern Ural area. There was a vast
area of preglacial population in northern Europe from the
Atlantic to the Ural Mountains. This population was the very
first wave of spread of <i>homo sapiens sapiens</i> to Europe.
This population could speak either relatively unitary Uralic
languages or quite different languages. Groups of this population
had linguistic and other contacts with each other in all
respects.</p>

<p>If there were quite different languages these entered into a
language union (Sprachbund) and by means of the intermediate <i>lingua
franca</i> these different languages unified until a definite
level but each one of them has preserved some features of the
initial language. If there were only relatively unitary Uralic
languages initially, they, too, have preserved some old features
of their own.</p>

<p>When traditional Uralic linguists reconstruct their
traditional Proto-Uralic language they may reconstruct, in the
first case, only an incomplete, not a normally functioning, or a
living, but only quite a poor intermediate <i>lingua franca</i>.
The reconstruction Proto-Uralic, in the second case, looks a
reasonable idea. Why not? And not dangerous for anybody. This
reconstruction tries to base on the evidence of the contemporary
Uralic languages. </p>

<p>But now a terrible mistake occurs. The traditional Uralists
forget that the reconstructed Proto-Uralic is in both cases only
a methodological tool and not a real language. They fetishize the
Proto-Uralic and believe it has linguistic evidence. From this
pseudo-evidence they begin to back-reconstruct the features and
details of the real living contemporary Uralic languages.</p>

<p>The so-called back-reconstruction is the worst they can do.
They say: in Proto-Uralic is the evidence of such and such a
feature or detail. They say: if so then all the contemporary
Uralic languages must have the traces of these Proto-Uralic
features or details or they have been deleted later. Why must
have, why deleted?! Here is really the place of a very serious
and dangerous mistake! This is where science ends and a party
game with conventional rules begins. And they call this game
scientific investigation of the history of Uralic languages!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><b>Uralic–Indo-European</b></p>

<p>There was no massive migration of
Indo-European-languages-speaking population to north. There was
only the so-called pioneer colonization of the Uralic-language-
speaking area by Indo-European-language-speaking people. Northern
Indo-European languages – Germanic, Baltic and Slavic – may
be the result of a transition of Uralic or any other old Northern
European-language-speaking population to an Indo-European
language form. New speakers of the Indo-European language form
spoke their new language poorly, with many phonetic and
morphosyntactic mistakes. We can see these mistakes even today in
the contemporary Germanic, Baltic and Slavic languages.</p>

<p>These mistakes or more exactly – phonetic and
morphosyntactic substratum – remind us of Uralic phonetics and
morphosyntax. Since today we have only the evidence of Germanic,
Baltic and Slavic languages, on the one hand, and Uralic
languages, on the other, we must compare this evidence with each
other. We can not do any more!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><b>Uralic – Siberian non-Uralic</b></p>

<p>There are very many common features between Uralic languages
and non-Uralic Siberian languages. They occur especially between
Siberian Uralic languages – Ob-Ugric and Samoyed – and the
so-called Paleosiberian and Altaic languages. Part of these
common features may be brought from Africa tens of thousands of
years ago in parallel to Europe and to Asia, but the other part
of these common features is the result of language contacts
between Uralic and non-Uralic languages in Siberia.</p>

<p>But there is no reason to believe that all features of – for
example – Samoyed languages existed once in the western
Finno-Ugric languages, too. Or in the alleged Proto-Uralic. We
must compare the evidence of Siberian Uralic and non-Uralic
languages with each other very carefully, in every detail.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><b>Some Morphological Features of Uralic
Languages</b></p>

<p align="center">*<i>m </i>- A c c u s a t i v e</p>

<p>In Finnic and Mordvin languages there is no <i>m</i>-accusative
evidence (neither in Permic languages), the evidence occurs in
Samoyed, Lapp and Mari languages and in some of the Mansi
dialects. In Finnic the task to denote the total object was given
to the <i>n</i>-genitive. The <i>m</i>-accusative of some Mansi
dialects could be a result of the influence of Samoyed languages.
</p>

<p>If we proceed from a widely spread supposition that the older
Uralic sentence was nominal and of the type SOV then it is quite
easy to imagine that earlier Finnish nominal sentences,
containing the genitive *<i>hän lehmä-n tappa-va</i> 'he,
slaughtering the cow' (the present tense) and *<i>hän lehmä-n
tappa-ja </i>'he, the slaughterer of the cow' (the preterite)
when this sentence type was transmitted into SVO-type, became <i>hän
tappa-a lehmä-n</i> 'he slaughters the cow' and <i>hän tappo-i
lehmä-n </i>'he slaughtered the cow'. So the <b><i>n</i></b><b>-genitive</b>
was changed into the case of the total object without supposing
that the <i>m</i>-accusative without any Finnic evidence would
have assimilated with the <i>n</i>-genitive due to the word final
change -<i>m</i> &gt; -<i>n</i>.</p>

<p align="center">O r d e r C x + P x </p>

<p>In his presentation "Zur Morphotaktik und Morphosyntax
der uralischen/finnisch-ugrischen Grundsprache", read at the
plenary session of the VIII International Finno-Ugric Congress in
Jyväskylä in 1995, Honti thoroughly analyses the mutual order
of case and possessive suffixes in Uralic languages and he
briefly concludes, "Die relative Abfolge der Kasus- und der
Possessivsuffixe war höchstwahrscheinlich von der Natur der
Kasussuffixe abhängig: die grammatischen Kasus traten hinter den
Possessivsuffixen auf (<b>PxCx</b>), die nicht-grammatischen
standen vor den Possessivsuffixen (<b>CxPx</b>)." (Honti
1995 : 78). To my judgement Honti considers this order typical of
U/FU proto-language.</p>

<p>I have dealt with the mutual case and possessive suffixes in
Uralic languages in my article "On Some Similarities between
Finnic–Lapp and Samoyed Languages", regarding CxPx as one
of the twelve similarities between the languages mentioned in the
title (Künnap 1996).<font size="4"> </font></p>

<p>The sequence PxCx has no proper evidence in Finnic. If we
abandon our speculations about the imaginary Proto-Uralic, I fail
to see any reason for the supposition that any other sequence
than CxPx should ever have occurred in the Finnic (and Lapp)
declination paradigm. The original order in the Samoyed
declination paradigm is also CxPx. Bearing these facts in mind, I
have indicated the co-occurrence of Finnic–Lapp–Samoyed in
case of the sequence CxPx. The mutual sequence of case suffixes
and possessive suffixes of other Uralic languages is a different
problem and requires separate observation. I would only mention
in advance that contacts with <b>Turkic languages</b> can by no
means be excluded there. (See closer in Künnap 1998a.) </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><b>Similarities between East-Uralic and
Siberian Non-Uralic Languages</b></p>

<p align="center">O b - U g r i c – S a m o y e d *<font face="1 FU">\ </font>- P r e t e r i t e</p>

<p>The use of the supposed *<font face="1 FU">\</font>-preterite
in Uralic is <b>very sporadic</b>. If we leave aside its use in
the negative auxiliary verb we could conclude that it is used
only in Mordvin, Mari, Mansi, Khanty, Nenets, Enets, Nganasan and
Selkup. At that in Mordvin preterite suffix *<font face="1 FU">\</font>
is used only in the 3rd person singular and plural. In Mari it is
still not quite clear whether it is *<font face="1 FU">\</font>-preterite
suffix or the 3rd person’s generalized personal suffix. In
Nenets and Enets its use is limited to interrogative sentences,
in addition to which in Nenets *<font face="1 FU">\</font>-forms
have modal shades of meaning.</p>

<p>In <b>the negative auxiliary verb</b> the supposed *<font face="1 FU">\</font>-preterite is used only in Estonian,
Livonian, Lapp, Mordvin, Mari, Nenets, Enets and Nganasan. In
Estonian the *<font face="1 FU">\</font>-preterite suffix is used
for all three persons only in Kodavere subdialect of the eastern
dialect but in widespread southern dialects only the particle <i>es</i>
is used to form the negative preterite for all three persons. In
Lapp <font face="1LiTNRi">^^ </font>&lt; *<font face="1 FU">n?</font>
is used instead of the preterite suffix *<font face="1 FU">\</font>
in the negative auxiliary verb, the former being used only in
Swedish-Lapp dialects. *<font face="1 FU">n? </font>would
require proceeding from the archetype *<font face="1 FU">n\</font>.
In case of the negative auxiliary verb in Mari we encounter the
same uncertainty as in case of the main verb.</p>

<p>We face the problem whether in Uralic the recession of the
generally used *<font face="1 FU">\</font>-preterite has taken
place or whether we are concerned with its different scope of
development in different languages.</p>

<p>At present I am of the opinion that the *<font face="1 FU">\</font>-preterite
is a phenomenon, limited to <b>Ob-Ugric and Samoyed languages</b>,
which can also extend to Mordvin. Finnic and Lapp (just as Mari,
Udmurt, Komi and Hungarian) have never known any Proto-Uralic *<font face="1 FU">\</font>-preterite, not even in case of the negative
auxiliary verb.</p>

<p>Taking into account the fact that the *<font face="1 FU">\</font>-preterite,
typical of Samoyed, Ob-Ugric and Mordvin, may have equivalents in
Paleo-Siberian languages, then, based on the above
considerations, there is every reason to regard the *<font face="1 FU">\</font>-preterite as <b>a phenomenon, related to the
Siberian language area, </b>first and foremost, which has never
been known in Finnic, Lapp, Mari, Permic and Hungarian. (See
closer in Künnap 1998b.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">O b - U g r i c – S a m o y e d *<i>k </i>- P
r e s e n s</p>

<p>Here I would briefly consider the occurrence of the *<i>k</i>-present
tense in Uralic languages in general. I would say it is <b>most
sporadic</b>. First of all we have to discriminate really
existing evidence from an imagined one. The imagined evidence,
I’d say, the dreamt-of material is abundant. All the
“back-reconstructions” of the present-tense forms <i>á la</i>
*<i>tule</i>-<i>k</i>-<i>mek </i>(Finnish <i>tulemme</i>) 'we
come' is only a fantasy without the least evidence. What I bear
in mind is more narrowly the present-tense conjugation paradigm
of the indicative mood, not of the imperative or a negation form
or something of the kind. In this sense a genuine evidence can be
found in Ob-Ugric languages, e.g. in Mansi <i>tot</i><font face="1 FU">E</font>-<font face="1 FU">QE</font>-<i>m</i> 'I
carry', <i>tot</i><font face="1 FU">E</font>-<font face="1 FU">Q+·</font>-<i>n</i>
'you carry' etc. The evidence of the *<i>k</i> of the present
tense is completely lacking in Samoyed languages, there is *<font face="1 FU">q </font>instead. If the Samoyed general *<font face="1 FU">q </font>of the aorist can be observed as a definite
equivalent to Finno-Ugric *<i>k</i> of the present tense, we
could speak only about an Ob-Ugric–Samoyed evidence, to which
the Permic-Volgaic evidence in the negative auxiliary is added.
Such a distribution makes the occurrence of the PU *<i>k</i> of
the present tense as evidence in the indicative conjugation
paradigm of the negative auxiliary of Permic-Volgaic languages
very debatable, as I see it. (See closer in Künnap 1998b.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">O b - U g r i c – S a m o y e d *<i>k </i>- D
u a l</p>

<p>The possibility of non-existence of the *<i>k</i>-dual traces
in Hungarian has been taken into account many a time, though at
least the traces are not entirely clear or definite. There is <b>no
reliable basis</b> to assume that *<i>k</i>-dual was used in all
Proto-Uralic and that later it disappeared from the majority of
Uralic languages. I have restricted the clearly obvious sphere of
occurrence of the old *<i>k</i>-dual in Uralic languages sphere
to the merely easternmost Uralic languages in the neighbourhood
of Paleo-Siberian although not immediately in the neighbourhood
of those using <i>k </i>as those are farther away – <b>Eskimo</b>,
<b>Aleut</b> and <b>Gilyak</b> (Pusztay 1980 : 51). But still,
there they are. (See closer in Künnap 1985.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">S a m o y e d *<font face="1 FU">q </font>- A o
r i s t / I m p e r a t i v e</p>

<p>There is nothing left to suppose that in Samoyed languages the
<b>aorist/imperative marker </b>*-<font face="1 FU">q</font><i>a</i>-
has proceeded from a Proto-Samoyed *<font face="1 FU">q</font>-type
marker of <b>the verbal noun</b>. Strictly speaking, in the given
case it can be regarded as the transition of the verbal noun
marker into the marker of aorist/imperative since the actual
verbal noun use is not observable any more.</p>

<p>Naturally, a question arises if there are any equivalents to
the verbal suffix *<font face="1 FU">q</font> of Samoyed
languages in their neighbouring <b>non-Uralic</b> language
families. <b>Turkic languages</b> know the second person
imperative marker -<font face="1 FU">q</font>. Here we may simply
come across a more general marker of the second person. It should
also be mentioned that -<i>a</i>- seems to be <b>an old
present/future and optative marker</b> of Turkic languages. In <b>Yenisey
languages</b> <font face="1 FU">q</font> occurs in a number of
verb forms, among others, in the present tense and the imperative
mood without obviously being a specific marker of the latter. In
the <b>Tungus-Manchu family</b> of languages the Evenk -<font face="1 FU">q</font><i>a</i>- expresses a further future, the
suffix -<font face="1 FU">q</font><i>n</i><font face="1LiTNRi"><i>á</i></font>-
indicates some further adhortative, e.g. <i>ana</i>-<font face="1 FU">q</font><i>n</i><font face="1LiTNRi"><i>á</i></font><i>-m</i>
‘I will push (later)’ (Jazyki 1968 : 79–80). The Even
language has an optative with the suffix -<font face="1 FU">q</font><i>a</i>-,
-<font face="1 FU">q</font><i>a</i>-, -<font face="1 FU">q</font><i>e</i>-
is a final component of a potential participle suffix. In Koryak
of <b>the Chukchi-Kamchatkan family</b> of languages -<font face="1 FU">q</font>- is one of the suffixes for the
present/future and for expressing recommendatory action. A
similar -<font face="1 FU">q</font>- can also be found in the
future tense of Alyutor and Kerek, in the latter in the present
tense, too. (See closer in Künnap 1994.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">S o u t h - S a m o y e d *<i>l </i>- l a t i v
e</p>

<p>The comparison of the South Samoyed<i> </i><b><i>l-</i></b><b>lative</b>
with the locative-lative (more exactly with adessive-allative)
(suffix -<i>l</i>V) of a neighbouring language, viz. of Evenk
(Tungus) belonging to the Tungus-Manchu language family, is of a
particular interest. The similar phenomenon can also be met in
the Even language belonging to the language family mentioned
above. (See closer in Künnap 1995.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">S o u t h - S a m o y e d *<i>l </i>- g e r u n
d</p>

<p>Taking a look around among non-Uralic Siberian languages it is
intriguing to compare the South Samoyed <i>l</i>-gerunds with the
<i>l</i>-gerund expressing the purpose of an action in the
languages of <b>the Mongol language family</b>, such as Mongor
(the suffix -<i>la</i>), Baoan (the suffix -<i>le</i>) and
Dongxiang (the suffix -<i>le</i>). The usages of <i>l</i>-suffixes
in Uralic and the so-called Altaic languages have generally much
in common, first of all in forming as denominal nouns, denominal
verbs as well as deverbal verbs. <b>Turkic languages</b> have
similar gerunds of compound suffixes whereby the final <i>l</i>-component,
coalescing with the suffixes of verbal nouns, is supposed to be
the suffix of the comitative case. It is worth mentioning that
also the gerundial suffix -<i>lu</i>-, -<i>l</i><font face="1 FU"><i>+</i></font>-
in <b>Eskimo</b> and -<i>l</i> in <b>Aleut</b> are used. (See
closer in Künnap 1995.)</p>
